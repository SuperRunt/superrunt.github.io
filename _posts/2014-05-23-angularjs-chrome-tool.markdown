Any time you're building single page web apps, with a ton of javascript, it can be tough to troubleshoot.
Fortunately, I write a lot of AngularJS code, and there is a great Chrome developer tools extension available from
the AngularJS team. With this tool you can follow models and scopes, dig deeper in DOM elements, and check on
dependencies.

The feature I use the most is the scope inspector. Being able to pick a scope, see the scope variables, and
then trigger a show element on it, is really handy!

The extension has even more features than the ones I listed. Check it out over at [GitHub](https://github.com/angular/angularjs-batarang),
and/or the [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ighdmehidhipcmcojjgiloacoafjmpfk).
