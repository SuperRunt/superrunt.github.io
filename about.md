I'm a programmer. I write lots of obj-C and Javascript, and some RoR and PHP. I don't like talking
about myself, so check out the links to my virtual life in the header. ;-)

Since this page is almost empty, I might as well tell a joke:

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;"><img src="/assets/img/EHzF9.jpeg"></div>
